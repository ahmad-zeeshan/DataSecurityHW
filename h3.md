**Homework-3**



**1-Reconnaissance:** It is at this point that the adversary is gathering information that can be used to plan future operations.

- _Phishing_: The adversary may try to send the phishing messages to gather actionable information.

**2-Resource Development:** The adversary is trying to establish resources they can use to support operations.

- _Acquire Infrastructure_: Botnet is a group of Internet-connected devices, each of which runs one or more bots. Botnets can be used to perform Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, steal data, send spam, and allow the attacker to access the device and its connection.

**3-Initial Access:** The adversary is attempting to get into your network. 

- _spearphishing attachments_: The adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to gain access to victim systems.

**4-Execution:** The adversary had illicit access and all resources to execute malicious code.

- _Unix Shells_: The adversary may abuse unix shell commands to run malicious scripts or commands.

**5-Persistence:** At this stage, the adversary is trying to maintain his access by performing configuration changes.

- _SSH Keys_: The adversaries may modify the SSH keys `<user-home>/.ssh/authorized_keys` file to maintain persistence on a victim host.

**6-Privilege Escalation** The adversary is trying to get the root level access by exploiting the system's weakness, misconfs, and vulnerabilities.

- _Sudo and Sudo Caching_: Adversaries may perform sudo caching and/or use the sudoers file to elevate privileges. This is because `sudo` has the ability to cache credentials for a period of time. Sudo creates (or touches) a file at `/var/db/sudo` with a timestamp of when sudo was last run to determine this timeout. 

**7-Defense Evasion:** The adversary is trying to avoid being detected.

- _Hidden Files & Directories_: Adversaries may set files and directories to be hidden to evade detection mechanisms.

**8-Credential Access:** The adversary is trying to steal account names and passwords.

- _Brute Force_: a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly.

**9-Discovery:** The adversary is trying to figure out your environment. This consists of techniques an adversary may use to gain knowledge about the system and internal network.

- _Network Sniffing:_ The adversaries may sniff network traffic to capture information about an environment, including authentication material passed over the network.

**10-Lateral Movement:** The adversary is trying to move through your environment. They might install their own remote access tools to accomplish Lateral Movement or use legitimate credentials with native network.

- _RDP Hijacking:_ Adversaries may hijack a legitimate userâ€™s remote desktop session to move laterally within an environment.

**11-Collection:** The adversary is trying to gather data of interest to their goal.

- _Code Repos_: The adversaries may leverage code repositories to collect valuable information

**12-Command and Control:** The adversary is trying to communicate with compromised systems to control them.

- _File Transfer Protocol_: The adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with transferring files to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. 

**13-Exfiltration:** The adversary is trying to steal data.

- _Exfiltration Over Physical Medium:_ The adversaries may attempt to exfiltrate data via a physical medium, such as a removable drive

**14-Impact:** The adversary is trying to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy your systems and data.

- _Disk Wipe:_ Adversaries may wipe or corrupt raw disk data on specific systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources.

Malicious code injected into trusted context (e.g., maclicious data presented by trusted website interepreted as code by the user's browser). It exploits the trust a user has for a particular website.
