**Homework-4**

**Active and Passive reconnaissance**

- Passive reconnaissance is an attempt to gain information about targeted computers and networks without actively engaging with the systems.

- It is also used for ethical hacking, in which white hat hackers use attack methods to determine system vulnerabilities.

- It is important to find out if sensitive information is available online which can be exploited.

- Active reconnaissance is a type of computer attack in which an intruder engages with the targeted system to gather information about vulnerabilities

- The attacker engages with the target system, typically conducting a port scan to determine find any open ports.

**NMAP**

Namp is most popular tool for port scanning. There are six port states recognized by Nmap:

Open: An application is actively accepting TCP connections, UDP datagrams or SCTP associations on this port. Finding these is often the primary goal of port scanning. Each open port is an opportunity for an attack. Open ports are the ones that attackers and pen-testers want to exploit.

Closed: A closed port is accessible (it receives and responds to Nmap probe packets), but there is no application listening on it.

Filtered: Nmap cannot determine whether the port is open because packet filtering prevents its probes from reaching the port. These ports provide little information.

Unfiltered: The unfiltered state means that a port is accessible, but Nmap is unable to determine whether it is open or closed. Some other types of scans may help to resolve whether the port is open.

Open-filtered: Nmap places ports in this state when it is unable to determine whether a port is open or filtered. This occurs for scan types in which open ports give no response.

Closed-filtered: This state is used when Nmap is unable to determine whether a port is closed or filtered.

**Metaspoilt 2 - Intentional Insecure Operating system**

- Go to VirtualBox and setup virtual network. 

- Install metaspoilt 2 VM in Virtual Box

- You can find the ISO images here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/
https://www.metasploit.com/download 

- Setup virtual network for metaspoilt since it is super insecure and shouldnt have internet, and also we are gonna run mysterious nmap.

The system is basically open for all sort of attacks.


**FTP Scanning**

Scanning plays an important role in penetration testing because through scanning attacker make sure which services and open ports are available for enumeration and attack.

Here we are using nmap for scanning port 21.

```
➜  nmap -p 21 192.168.56.3
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-09-21 00:51 EEST

Host is up (0.00041s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE
21/tcp open  ftp

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.05 seconds
```

Results:

- Nmap show open STATE for port 21. 

- Anonymous logins are enabled in vsftpd.conf

```

We could use -A for aggressive scan which would reveal quite sensitive information.

`nmap -T4 -A 192.168.0.0/24`

The -A tells nmap to perform OS checking and version checking. The -T4 is for the speed template, these templates are what tells nmap how quickly to perform the scan. The speed template ranges from 0 for slow and stealthy to 5 for fast and obvious

would return for instance:
