**Homework 2**

**A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration**

- Incorrectly configured permissions, unnecessary ports open, and incorrect privileges, among others, can lead to vulnerable applications.
- The error handling may reveal secrets if incorrect settings are enabled for logging. 
- Several security features are either disabled or not used at all.
- Regular release deployment cycles should harden the system. Using infrastructure as code, the entire process can be automated.
- It is important to conduct server validation tests in order to verify the success of the configuration.

**A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components**

- Vulnerable components (OS or software packages, applications, runtime environments) in the client and server-side code.
- Insecure software configuration
- Old/unpatched dependencies in the dependency chain of the components being used.
- Maintain an inventory of components/packages that you are using and ensure that they are kept up-to-date via regular release cycles.
- Reduce attack surfaces by removing unneeded dependencies and components.
- Install packages via trusted channels and make sure to validate their integrity.

**A03:2021 – Injection**

- User input is implicitly trusted, without any sanitization, filtering or escaping.
- Malicious users could control the response generated by the application and maybe even control the servers.
- The happens when data enetered by user get mixed with the interpreter and leads to SQL Injection, Command Injection, Server Side Template Injection, Header Injection, Content Injection (XSS, HTML Injection, CSS Injection).
- Never trust user input since it could leads to disasters. Keep a safelist of characters that can be expected in the input. Reject any input that is malformed or unexpected.

**Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)**

CVE, short for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, is a list of publicly disclosed computer security flaws. When someone refers to a CVE, they mean a security flaw that's been assigned a CVE ID number.

**Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-44832)**

Apache Log4j is a Java-based logging utility. Log4j Java library’s role is to log information that helps applications run smoothly, determine what’s happening, and help with the debugging process when errors occur.

Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-beta7 through 2.17.0 (excluding security fix releases 2.3.2 and 2.12.4) are vulnerable to a remote code execution (RCE) attack where an attacker with permission to modify the logging configuration file can construct a malicious configuration using a JDBC Appender with a data source referencing a JNDI URI which can execute remote code.
