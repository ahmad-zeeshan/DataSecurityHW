**Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations**

- Messages are plaintext (or cleartext in some cases). The process of disguising a message in such a way as to hide its substance is **encryption**. 
- An encrypted message is a **ciphertext**. 
- The process of turning ciphertext back into plaintext is **decryption**. 
- The art and science of keeping messages secure is **cryptography**.
- Cryptanalysis, is the art, and science of breaking ciphertext; that is, seeing through the disguise.
- The branch of mathematics encompassing both cryptography and cryptanalysis is cryptology and its practitioners are cryptologists.
- The primary purpose of cryptography is to provide confidentiality of data, but it is also used for authentication, and to verify data integrity.
