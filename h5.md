**Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations**

- Messages are plaintext (or cleartext in some cases). The process of disguising a message in such a way as to hide its substance is **encryption**. 
- An encrypted message is a **ciphertext**. 
- The process of turning ciphertext back into plaintext is **decryption**. 
- The art and science of keeping messages secure is **cryptography**.
- Cryptanalysis, is the art, and science of breaking ciphertext; that is, seeing through the disguise.
- The branch of mathematics encompassing both cryptography and cryptanalysis is cryptology and its practitioners are cryptologists.
- The primary purpose of cryptography is to provide confidentiality of data, but it is also used for authentication, and to verify data integrity.

**Presentation Topic**

My presentation will be about **Hashicorp Vault**, a security management system that manages secrets and encryption.

- Quick Intro of Vault
- Usecases
- Demo using Vault dev server
- CLI commands

Note: Use "gpg --full-generate-key" for a full featured key generation dialog.

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Zeeshan
Email address: zeeshan@foo.com
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Zeeshan <zeeshan@foo.com>"

Change (N)ame, (E)mail, or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

Encryption

-e: --encryp
-a: armor

```
→ gpg -e -a -r "Zeeshan" somefile
gpg: checking the trustdb
gpg: marginals needed: 3  completes needed: 1  trust model: pgp
gpg: depth: 0  valid:   1  signed:   0  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 1u
gpg: next trustdb check due at 2024-09-26
```

It would result in .asc file.

```
→ ls -larth somefile*
   rw-r--r--   1   zeeshan.ahmad   staff    317 B     Tue Sep 27 13:17:37 2022    somefile.asc
   rw-r--r--   1   zeeshan.ahmad   staff     13 B     Tue Sep 27 13:16:29 2022    somefile.txt
```

Decryption

```
→ gpg -d somefile.asc
gpg: encrypted with cv25519 key, ID 18E9D394B3938115, created 2022-09-27
