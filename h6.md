**Weaponizing the SCP Vulnerability - Harry Sintonen on Disobey**


In his presentation named "Weaponizing the SCP Vulnerability," F-Secure's Senior Security Consultant Harry Sintonen described how he discovered several vulnerabilities in programs that implement the SCP network protocol.

In a nutshell, Secure Copy is a network protocol that facilitates data transfers between hosts and is a secure version of its predecessor RCP. SCP programs are normally command-line tools, like the scp program (yeah, the program name matches the protocol name).

Sintonen found that when the SCP program is used, the server-side can change directory permissions on the client side (CVE-2018-20685) and control which files are sent to the client when the data transfer is in progress (CVE-2019-6111). In fact, SCP does not offer any duplication checking for transferred files, so if the server-side decides to transfer files with the same name that the destination has, the destination files are overwritten without any confirmation.

Sintonen showed that this can be used for malicious activities. For example in cases when the client .bash_profile file is overwritten with a file that contains malicious commands. In a normal situation, the client should see what files were transferred from the SCP's progress output and do appropriate actions before any malicious activity happens.

However, Sintonen found a vulnerability (CVE-2019-6109) that the server-side can use to manipulate the progress output on the client side making the detection of any malicious activity harder for the user.
