**Introduction and Background**

This paper presents a high-level framework for the continuous delivery quality assurance model, together
with the outcomes of its use in the ICT-IOT field. As soon as the developer checks in their code, the build is
executed under this software development methodology. The software development life cycle is a
methodical procedure for creating software. Several different approaches to software development might
be thought of as "lifecycle models," including the waterfall, V, spiral, extreme, agile, lean, and rapid
application development approaches. The quality gates and supporting practices used in the waterfall
model ensure that each step is completed with a high level of quality.

**Analysis**

In the agile methodology, the validation and verification process comes before testing and release. CI
design principles should underpin the whole build workflow. The needs of the client should be considered
while making provisions (customer environment inbuilt into the pipeline). Static code quality tools, tools for
detecting duplicate or dead code, and so on may all be included. There is the option of including static
quality check tools like ‘FindBugs’ to guarantee the integrity of the test code.
During the QA audit, non-conformances were detected as a result of the project, which is why the
suggested model is being used. This version's primary needs centered on IOT, or lightweight Internet
protocol. An open-source TCP/IP implementation made specifically for embedded computers is called
Lightweight IP (lwIP). “Increase in the number of product quality issues identified during QA audit” is
considered as (Y). With a score of 15 or above, the Yn was evaluated for the project's pilot phase. The
pilot's primary emphasis was on ensuring the pipeline's quality and preparing for continuous delivery.

**Findings**

Based on the model's findings, four audit cycles are carried out. The purpose of a hypothesis test is to see
whether a model can be made that better describes the CTQ (critical to quality) that has been found. The
team has not provided analysis for six of the ten masked rules. It is not clear from available assessments
which modules provide the most danger. SQA conducted a thorough investigation of the static tool
problems and drafted a road plan at the module level. Lack of feature-level organization in test suites will
have a domino effect on determining whether or not a feature is stable based on test case failures.

**Recommendations**

The QA expert must know more about the inner workings of DevOps and the technicalities of continuous
delivery, inspection/static quality assurance, and other related practices. This framework allows for more
flexibility in automating QA criteria, which in turn leads to increased predictability in product quality. So far,
so good with the suggested QA audit framework's (in continuous delivery mode of software development)
early deployment outcomes.
